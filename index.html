        <p>   
        1: Creating a new sites repository in Github
        </p>
        <p> 
        1.1: Click on "Create New"
        </p>
        <p> 
        1.2: Click on "New repository"
        </p>
        <p> 
        1.3: Enter a name for your repository as well as a description.
        </p>
        <p> 
        1.4:"Choose visisbility", Public visibility is free but private hosting requires a paid Github subscription"
        </p>
        <p> 
        1.5: "Add.gitignore" choose "No.gitignore" when you are using HTML, CSS or Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
        1.6: "Add licence" choose "MIT" if your coding won't involve any code that is of high value.
        </p>
        <p>
        1.7: Click on "Create repository"
        </p>
        <p>
        1.8: Create a local folder in your computer where you want to store your repository.
        </p>
        <p>
        2.1: Install a command line app like Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.
        </p>
        <p>
        2.2: Install a GUI for Git with the web extention for "TortioseGit" (https://tortoisegit.org/download/) if you prefer a GUI over the command line.
        </p>
        <p>
        3: Back on the main page of your Github repository, click on "Code" and copy the URL of your repository.
        </p>
        <p>
        4: Open your Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder where you want to create your local repository & Create a repository folder.
        </p>
        <p>
        5: Give your folder a name and enter the folder, right click in the folder and select "Git Clone" to clone the repository you created on Github which is stored in your Local clip board from step 3.
        </p>
        <p>
        6: Paste the URL of your repository in the "URL" field and click "OK" and wait for the cloning process to finish.
        </p>
        <p>
        7: Inside the cloned folder you will see a file called "LICENCE", create a new ".txt" file alongside it and name it (index.html), open DesktopGit, navigate to the "Current Repository" (top left corner) and select the cloned repository you created in step 5.
        </p>
        <p>
        8.1: Give a description of your project in the "Description" field and click on "Commit" to commit your changes.
        </p>
        <p>
        8.2: Click on "Push origin" to push your changes to the remote repository on Github (highlighted in blue) and wait for the push to complete, after this you should be able to launch the index.html file in your repository folder and it will open a web browser with the web contents that you have placed inside of the index.html file.
        </p>
        <p>
        9: You can now edit the index.html file in your favorite text editor (I will be using VS-Code), save it and then commit and push your changes to Github using DesktopGit.
        </p>
        <p>

        10.2: Right click on the repository folder and select "Open with Code" to open the folder in VS-Code.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
        10.4: Write your HTML code inside the index.html file, for example:
        </p>
        <pre>
        <p>
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        </p>
        <p>
            <html>
        </p>
        <p>
            <head>
        </p>

                <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            </body>
        </p>
        <p>
